Hello, Neovim users!

I decided to share a bit silly, but fun way to choose a color scheme you like. Maybe even have this in your startup config, if you feel particularly adventurous :)

It uses [mini.base16](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-base16.md) module of [mini.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.nvim) for both palette generation and color scheme application. Granted, results are not *that* different from one another (mainly because they share same highlight group definitions and idea behind making distinctive accent colors), but vary quite a bit.

Here is a [gist with code](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/2adeb8ca809126ce35ec644918fce413). It has the instructions of how to use it.
