After merging [this PR](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/24739), `nvim_open_win()` now supports `footer` and `footer_pos` options. They are symmetrical to `title` and `title_pos` options, but affect the bottom part of floating window border.

**Important**: this is a part of Neovim 0.10, not current stable Neovim 0.9.1. Will also be available in next Nightly build.

I am excited to see how Neovm community can leverage this. It seems like an appropriate place to show some help data alongside usual title. I have a few ideas for 'mini.nvim' myself :)
