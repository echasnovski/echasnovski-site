Hello, Neovim users!

Around two weeks ago I decided to make a [Neovim built-in options survey](./2022-11-22-neovim-builtin-options-survey-needs-your-contribution.qmd). Now it is closed, as it doesn't seem to have an intensive answer supply (last one was more than 24 hours ago).

There were total 227 legible answers. Not as many as I had hoped starting it, but it is what it is.

Main summary of basic options are in the post image. To answer questions in the survey announcement:

- `What Leader key is used the most?` - Space.
- `Tabs or spaces?` - Spaces (based on 82% of `expandtab=true`)
- `Absolute, relative, or no line numbers?` - Seems like both absolute and relative. But probably more absolute ones, based on 86% of `number=true`.
- `Traditional or global statusline?` - Global, but with a tight margin.
- `Permanent tabline or not?` - Not permanent, default one.
- `Use persistent undo or not?` - Yes to persistent undo
- `showmode or noshowmode?` - `noshowmode`
- `wrap or nowrap?` - `wrap`.

Here is [a gist with full results](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/fa70dc75c475369747d2a485a13303fb) along with description of how to read them and scripts used

I also created a [GitHub issue in Neovim repository](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21342) to discuss possibility of default values change. If you agree with changing options which reached 80% for some non-default value (as per [commentary of Justin M. Keys](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/z1tmjg/comment/ixfp0gn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), please upvote initial issue message.

Thanks for reading and participating!
